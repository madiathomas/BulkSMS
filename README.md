## BulkSMS

BulkSMS is an open source .NET Standard library for sending SMSes using Bulk SMS. It is very simple to use. It is using RestSharp to make HTTP calls to the Bulk SMS API in the background.

### How to use BulkSMS Library

Please check sample on how to use the library

### Bulk SMS Account

If you don't have an account with Bulk SMS yet, you can signup for it on Bulk SMS website -> https://www.bulksms.com/. They will give you some credits that you can use to test with.

This library will be extended in future to include other API calls currently not covered. These are the only API calls that I am making using Bulk SMS at the moment.

### Nuget Installation Instructions

Library also available as a Nuget package. 

To install it, simply run this nuget command on **Install-Package Recurso.BulkSMS**.
